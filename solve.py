"""
N tasks
	Each task consists of several subtasks
	Each subtask must be done in order
Two workers, Alice and Bob
	Each worker has four 30-min time slots
	Each subtask must be done by a specific worker

Example task list: 
task1 = ["A1", "B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["B2, "A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["B1", "A3", "B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]

Where in task1 "A1",
"A" stands for "assigned to Alice"
and "1" means the task takes 1 hour to complete. 

Example schedule where each worker puts in equal time:
Alice: 1A1 4A4
Bob: 3B1 1B2 2B1

Let's solve manually.

First round:
task1 = ["A1", "B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["B2, "A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["B1", "A3", "B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "1A1" => position 1 (has worked 1 hour)
B = "3B1" => position 1

Second round:
task1 = ["B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["B2, "A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["A3", "B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "3A3" => position 4 (has worked 4Â hours cumulative)
B = "2B2" => position 3

Third round:
task1 = ["B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "3A1" => 5
B = "3B1" => 4

Fourth round:
task1 = ["B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "1A1" => 6
B = "1B2" => 6

Fifth round:
task1 = ["B3"]
task2 = ["A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "2A2" => 8
B = "1B3" => 9

Sixth round:
task1 = []
task2 = ["B4", "A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "4A4" => 12
B = "2B4" => 13

Seventh round:
task1 = []
task2 = ["A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "2A3" => 15
B = "4B1" => 14

Eigth round:

task2 = []
task3 = []
task4 = ["A1"]
A = "4A1" => 16
B = "" => 14
