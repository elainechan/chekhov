# Requirements

## Basic
- [ ] Create a client prototype that allows non-technical users to do something interesting or valuable with the API.
- [ ] Serve static files: The server, in addition to offering a REST API, will need to serve your client and any other static assets (for instance, images).
- [ ] Implement a REST API with all four CRUD operations: Your app idea will determine the content of what your API offers, but at a minimum, your app should support all four CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
- [ ] Comprehensive Tests for the API Layer: Each API endpoint should have test coverage. At a minimum that means having tests for the normal case â€” that means that if you had, say an account creation endpoint, you'd have a test that proves that when the endpoint gets a POST request with the correct data, a new account is created, and the expected response is returned.
- [ ] Use Continuous Integration: set up continuous integration early on in your development process.
