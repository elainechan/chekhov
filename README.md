# Chekhov

When given a list of tasks, automatically build a schedule.

## Inputs/Outputs
- CSV
- JSON

## Constraints
- [ ] Each case consists of several tasks
- [ ] Each task must be scheduled before its deadline
- [ ] Each task must be scheduled in order of priority
- [ ] Some tasks can only commence when certain others are finished (upstream, downstream)
- [ ] No task can be left unscheduled for 48 hours
- [ ] Five workers: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Emily
	- [ ] Each task must be scheduled to the worker it is assigned to
	- [ ] Each worker has 5 billable hours daily (300 minutes)
	- [ ] Each worker has 3 buffer hours daily (180 minutes)

## Nice to have
- [ ] Priority should increase as idle time increases

- [ ] Schedule should refresh daily during off hours

## What if
- [ ] A task is not completed in scheduled time
- [ ] Worker is out sick
- [ ] Tasks are added/eliminated

## Definition of a Solution 
- Sufficient: 
	- [ ] Every task gets scheduled before its deadline
- Optimal:
	- [ ] Least total time required to finish all tasks
	- [ ] Least time wasted by workers waiting for completion of upstream task
	- [ ] Earlier completion of higher priority tasks

## Cost function
- Minimize:
	- total time to finish all tasks
	- total time wasted waiting for upstream completion
	- completion date of high-priority tasks

## Algorithm
### Search Tasks
- [x] Search Task list by several criteria:
	- Group
		- [x] Search for tasks that belong in groups
		- [x] Sort grouped tasks according to group name and group order 
		- [x] Search for earliest group order
		- [x] Pick the earliest group order
	- Idle
		- [x] Search for the longest idle time
		- [x] Pick the longest idle time
	- Priority
		- [x] Search for strongest priority
		- [x] Pick the strongest priority level
	- Length
		- [x] Search for the shortest length
		- [x] Pick the shortest task
### Pick
- [x] Pick by earliest Group order
	- [ ] Pick by Idle time
		- [ ] Pick by Priority level
			- [ ] Pick by Length
### Populate Agenda
- [ ] Search Worker schedule
	- [ ] Check if billable hours
		- [ ] If billable hours, schedule task to billable hours
	- [ ] If no billable hours, check if buffer hours
		- [ ] If buffer hours, schedule task to buffer hours
	- [ ] If no buffer hours
		- [ ] Alert manager

## Data Schema
![Data schema image](https://github.com/elainechan/chekhov/blob/master/assets/schema2.png)
- [x] **Task** _object_
	- [x] ID: _string_
	- [x] Deadline: _date_
	- [x] Priority: _enum_ _integer_ (1 to 4, related to[ ]  Deadline)
	- [x] Length: _integer_ (minutes)
	- [x] Last touched: _date_
	- [x] Idle: _integer_ (current time minus last touched)
	- [x] User ID: _string_
	- [x] Case ID: _string_
	- [x] Group ID (optional): _string_
	- [x] Group order (optional): _integer_
	- [x] Upstream task ID (optional): _string_
	- [x] Downstream task ID (optional): _string_
- [ ] **User** _object_
	- [ ] ID: _string_
	- [ ] Role: _enum_ (worker, manager)
	- [ ] Task IDs: _array_
	- [ ] Case IDs: _array_
	- [ ] Group IDs (optional): _array_
	- [ ] Billable hours: _integer_
	- [ ] Buffer hours: _integer_
- [ ] **Group** _object_
	- [ ] ID: _string_
	- [ ] Task IDs: _array_
	- [ ] Worker IDs: _array_
- [ ] **TaskList**
	- array of Task objects

## Simplified Manual Attempt
- Each task consists of several subtasks
- Each subtask must be done in order
- Example task list:
```
task1 = ["A1", "B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["B2, "A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["B1", "A3", "B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
```
Where in `task1` `A1`, `A` stands for "assigned to Alice" and `1` means the task takes 1 hour to complete. 

- Example schedule where each worker puts in equal time:
```
Alice: 1A1 4A4
Bob: 3B1 1B2 2B1
```

First round:
```
task1 = ["A1", "B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["B2, "A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["B1", "A3", "B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "1A1" => position 1 (has worked 1 hour)
B = "3B1" => position 1
```
Second round:
```
task1 = ["B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["B2, "A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["A3", "B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "3A3" => position 4 (has worked 4Â hours cumulative)
B = "2B2" => position 3
```
Third round:
```
task1 = ["B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = ["B1", "A1"]
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "3A1" => 5
B = "3B1" => 4
```
Fourth round:
```
task1 = ["B2", "A1", "B3"]
task2 = ["A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "1A1" => 6
B = "1B2" => 6
```
Fifth round:
```
task1 = ["B3"]
task2 = ["A2", "B4", "A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "2A2" => 8
B = "1B3" => 9
```
Sixth round:
```
task1 = []
task2 = ["B4", "A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["A4", "B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "4A4" => 12
B = "2B4" => 13
```
Seventh round:
```
task1 = []
task2 = ["A3"]
task3 = []
task4 = ["B1", "A1", "B1"]
A = "2A3" => 15
B = "4B1" => 14
```
Eigth round:
```
task1 = []
task2 = []
task3 = []
task4 = ["A1"]
A = "4A1" => 16
B = "" => 14
```
